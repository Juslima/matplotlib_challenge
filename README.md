Introduction:

The purpose of the study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, against other treatment regimens in reducing tumor development in mice with SCC tumors. The study included 249 mice that received various drug regimens, and the tumor development was observed and measured over a period of 45 days.

Analysis Summary:

Data Cleaning: The initial analysis involved cleaning the data by removing any duplicate mouse entries. After removing the duplicate mouse data, the dataset contained information on 248 unique mice.

Summary Statistics: A summary statistics table was generated to provide insights into the tumor volume for each treatment regimen. The table included mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM for the tumor volume. This summary statistics table allows for a quick comparison of the effectiveness of different treatment regimens.

Bar and Pie Charts: Bar plots were generated to visualize the total number of mice for each drug regimen. This provides an overview of the distribution of mice across different treatments. Additionally, pie charts were created to show the distribution of female and male mice in the study. These visualizations help in understanding the gender distribution in the study population.

Quartiles, Outliers, and Boxplots: The final tumor volume of mice treated with four specific regimens (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin) was analyzed. The quartiles, potential outliers, and boxplots were generated to compare the distribution of tumor volumes among these treatment groups. Identifying potential outliers helps in assessing any unusual observations in the data.

Line and Scatter Plots: A line plot was created to visualize the tumor volume change over time for a single mouse treated with Capomulin. This plot shows the effectiveness of Capomulin in reducing tumor volume over the treatment period. Additionally, a scatter plot was generated to explore the relationship between mouse weight and the average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen. This plot helps in understanding the correlation between these two variables.

Correlation and Regression: The correlation coefficient between mouse weight and the average observed tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen was calculated. The strong positive correlation (correlation coefficient of 0.84) indicates that mouse weight is a significant factor in predicting tumor volume. A linear regression model was also created to visualize the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume.

Observations or Inferences:

1. Tumor Volume vs. Time Point for a Single Mouse: The line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a single mouse treated with Capomulin shows a decreasing trend over time. This indicates that the Capomulin treatment may be effective in reducing tumor volume in this specific mouse.

2. Mouse Weight vs. Average Tumor Volume: The scatter plot of mouse weight vs. the average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen shows a positive correlation between weight and tumor volume. As the weight of the mouse increases, the average tumor volume tends to increase as well. This suggests that there might be a relationship between mouse weight and tumor development.

3. Correlation between Mouse Weight and Average Tumor Volume: The correlation coefficient between mouse weight and the average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen is 0.84. This indicates a strong positive correlation between the two variables. The higher the weight of the mouse, the higher the average tumor volume tends to be. This correlation coefficient suggests that mouse weight can be a significant factor in predicting tumor volume for mice under the Capomulin treatment regimen.
